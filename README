== Germanize

Learning German (or other Languages with modifications)

I developed this app for making learning the German language more easy.
You can add words and some information will be retrieved from dict.leo (Chinese Translation),
wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de (Grammar, examples, etc.).


If you guess a word correctly (or wrong) it will get a new position in the queue of words that show up next.
That means: the more often you guess correctly, the more seldom the word will appear

=== TODO
(forks are welcome :D)
* English Translation (most strings are i18n so copying de.yml to en.yml and lets go)
* images according to word (images make learning more easy)
* word collocations
* exercises customizable
